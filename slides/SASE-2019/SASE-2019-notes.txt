Pachinko machine manufacturer Sammy consistently posts strong earnings by developing new-concept products. Needless to say, a pachinko machine's value lies in the "leisure time enjoyment" it provides to a pachinko player. Yet while a pachinko machine's functionality can be described along various dimensions, the cause and effect relationship between particular combinations of functionality – and the enjoyment each produces – is extremely unclear. Functionality explains only a tiny portion of the value produced through an invisible innovation.
