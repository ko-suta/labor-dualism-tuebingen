  abstract = {In this paper we study the occupational progress and earnings attainment of immigrants in Germany and compare them to native Germans. Our analysis is guided by the human capital, segmented labor market, and discrimination theories. To assess the separate effects of occupational segmentation and discrimination in the allocation of occupations and wages, we conceptualize the process of earnings attainment as occurring in three stages: initial occupational achievement, final occupational achievement after the accumulation of experience, and, contingent on the former, final earnings attainment. Our analysis of data from the German Socioeconomic Panel suggests a high degree of initial occupational segmentation, with mmigrants being less able to translate their human capital into a good first job than natives. We also find that immigrants experienced significant discrimination in the process of occupational attainment, yielding little job mobility over time, and a widening of the status gap between Germans and guestworkers. Holding occupational status constant, however, we find less evidence of direct discrimination in the process of earnings attainment. Although immigrants achieved lower rates of return to technical or vocational training than natives, their wage returns to experience, hours worked, years since migration, and academic high school were greater, yielding significant earnings mobility over time.},

However, there is an alternative\textemdash labor market segmentation theory. Labor market segmentation was advanced as an alternative to human capital theory by several authors in the early 1970s. After a brief period of popularity, it faded after influential critiques suggested that existing evidence did not differentiate between labor market segmentation and standard human capital theory Wachter 1974; Cain 1976. In the last decade several important theoretical and empirical developments have generated a resurgence of interest in the theory.},

  abstract = {Dual labor market theory asserts that the American labor market is sharply divided between good jobs and bad jobs, and that mobility between these two segments of the market is severely restricted. The new labor market segmentation thesis argues that, as the practice of allocating workers to inferior jobs on the basis of race and sex has declined, employers have turned to nonstandard work arrangements and immigrants to supply labor for low-wage jobs. This paper presents a new method for measuring labor market dualism and identifying discrete labor market segments. This method allows us to examine the distribution of workers across these segments over the life course and to estimate the effects of nonstandard work and citizenship status on creating and placing workers into bad jobs. Three major findings are evident from this research. First, since the early 1970s the level dualism in the American labor market has increased substantially. Second, most workers who begin their careers in the secondary (bad) jobs eventually leave this labor market for better jobs, After young adulthood, most of the workforce is roughly divided between primary (good) intermediary (mediocre) jobs. Finally, results from the multivariate analysis support the new segmentation hypothesis. Combined, nonstandard work and citizenship now play a greater direct role in allocating workers to secondary and intermediary jobs than race or sex.},

The consequences of working in nonstandard employment relations differ depending on workers' individual and collective control over skills and other valued resources.},

  abstract = {The French and German political economies have been significantly reconfigured over the past two decades. Although the changes have often been more piecemeal than revolutionary, their cumulative effects are profound. The authors characterize the changes that have taken place as involving the institutionalization of new forms of dualism and argue that what gives contemporary developments a different character from the past is that dualism is now explicitly underwritten by state policy. They see this outcome as the culmination of a sequence of developments, beginning in the field of industrial relations, moving into labor market dynamics, and finally finding institutional expression in welfare state reforms. Contrary to theoretical accounts that suggest that institutional complementarities support stability and institutional reproduction, the authors argue that the linkages across these realms have helped to translate employer strategies that originated in the realm of industrial relations into a stable, new, and less egalitarian model with state support.},

  abstract = {Active labour-market policy is an important tool for governments interested in the promotion of employment. This article explores a topic in the comparative political economy literature in need of more attention: the politics behind the promotion of active labour policies. It is argued here that social democratic governments are often not interested in employment promotion measures; labour is divided into those with secure employment (insiders) and those without (outsiders); it is contended that social democratic governments have strong incentives to pursue labour-market policies that benefit insiders but not outsiders. There are factors, however, that either exacerbate or limit the effects of insider\textendash outsider differences on social democracy. These claims are tested in three ways. First, the interplay of government partisanship and employment protection is explored in the British case. Secondly, the individual preferences assumed in the model are tested with Eurobarometer data. And thirdly, the effects of social democracy on active labour-market policy are analysed using data from sixteen industrialized democracies.},

It argues that the path-dependent trajectories of labor market and social protection reforms biased in favor of labor market insiders explain recent institutional developments in the two countries. In Japan, political coalitions between conservative policymakers, large firms, and core regular workers in reform politics consolidated labor market dualism and inequality during its protracted recession. Meanwhile, the organizational capacity of large chaebol unions deepened the inequality and the segmentation of the dualistic labor market in Korea. By examining three key institutional domains of the labor market\textemdash labor market reform, wage bargaining, and social protection\textemdash this article analyzes the ways in which Japan and Korea have reinforced dualism and inequality over the past two decades.},

We examine differences in how employer coordination has been organized in Sweden, Germany, and Japan in the area of industrial relations, and we examine the extent to which such coordination represents a self-sustaining equilibrium, as some of the most influential treatments suggest. To preview the findings, we argue that precisely the intensification of cooperation between labor and management in some firms and industries (that the ``varieties of capitalism'' literature correctly emphasizes) has paradoxically had deeply destabilizing collateral effects that have undermined or are undermining these systems as they were traditionally constituted. All three cases are characterized not so much by a full-blown breakdown of coordination so much as a very significant reconfiguration of the terms and scope of such coordination. Specifically, all three countries feature the emergence of new or intensified forms of dualism\textemdash different in each case based on different starting points\textemdash in which continued coordination within a smaller core has in some ways been underwritten through the breaking off of other, more peripheral, firms and workers.},
