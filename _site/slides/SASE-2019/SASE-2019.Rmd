## Does labor flexibility benefit innovation?

--

.pull-left[
* **Merits** 
  + Easier reallocation to more dynamic sectors
  + More incentives to take risks
  + Job matches ðŸ¢‚ productivity
  + "Fresh blood" inflow
]

--

.pull-right[
* **Demerits**
  + Stronger labor protection ðŸ¢‚ higher wages and productivity
  + Development of firm-specific skills
  + Trust ðŸ¢‚ productivity
  + Innovation requires long-term incentives, not short-term punishments (Kleinknecht et al., 2014)
]

---

## Focus & Literature gap 

--

* Focus on **numerical labor flexibility**
  + "addresses the variation of quantity of labor input" (Arvantis, 2005),
  + reflects the ability of firms to use the external labor market to replace regular employees and/or to use temporary employees on fixed-term and part-time contracts, often through temporary employment agencies? (Kato & Zhou, 2018).

--
  
* **Literature gap** 
  + previous studies on this topic have mostly concentrated on European cases. Only Kato & Zhou (2018) have recently conducted the study on Japan's startup companies 
  + Kato & Zhou (2018) innovation proxy is a dummy variable (yes/no), mine is the number of applications and citations

## Distribution of patent applications across industries 

```{r industries, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/image1.png")
```

---

## "Electricity" subindustries with most patent applications 

```{r electricity, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/image2.png")
```

---

## "Necessities" subindustries with most patent applications  

```{r necessities, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/image3.png")
```

---

## Companies with highest numbers of patent applications 

--

.pull-left[
* **Electricity & Communications**
  + Panasonic: 15009
  + Toshiba: 14028
  + Mitsubishi Electric: 13219
  + Canon: 13165
  + Toyota Motor: 10150
  + Sharp: 8874
  + Fujitsu: 8075
  + Sony: 7530
]

--

.pull-right[
* **Necessities (incl. "Games")**
  + Sankyo : 9168
  + Sega Sammy Holdings : 3896
  + Universal Entertainment : 2886
  + Heiwa : 2434
  + Terumo: 2272
  + Fujishoji : 2253
  + Iseki: 1859
  + Unicharm : 1441
]

---

## Methodology 

--

* **(Sub-) Industries analyzed** 
  + Electricity and Communications ðŸ¢‚ "Semiconductors" 
  + Necessities ðŸ¢‚ "Games"

--

* **Sources:**
  + The Institute of Intellectual Property Patent Database (IIP-DB): patent application data. Companies having > 5 applications (Lechevalier et al., 2010)
  + Nikkei NEEDS Financial Database: corporate data

--

* **Innovation proxy (dependent variable)**
  + Patent applications: "represent the development of new and technically feasible devices" (Kato & Zhou, 2018) â€” `quantity aspect` 
  + Patent citations â€” `quality aspect` (Acharya, Baghai et al., 2010)

---

## Possible conceptualization 

--

* **Visible innovations** â€” overcoming commoditization along established lines. Value results from function.

--

* **Invisible innovations** (Kusunoki, 2006)
  + "Rather than boosting existing dimensions, it paints an entirely new picture of how, why, and to whom a new product or service should appeal" (ibid). `Value ~ function` is unclear 
  + "Once a company succeeds in establishing a new product concept, it is often able to produce powerful loyalty and brand effects that trump dimensional superiority" (ibid).
  + Importance of product-customer interaction

--

* Japan is relatively **weak** in knowledge-based industries. **Gaming** is as an exception (Aoyama & Izushi, 2003).

--

* Japan's **dual labor market** ðŸ¢‚ possibility of transition from non-regular to regular employment is only 1.7 to 10.3 percent. **Gaming industry** as an exception (Casper & Storz, 2016).

## Variables ðŸ¢‚ Operationalization 

--

* `Process innovation`: Investment / Capital Stock (Brouwer & Kleinknecht, 1997; Sterlacchini, 1998; Fukao, Ikeuchi et al., 2017)

--

* `Internationalization`: Exports / Sales

--

* `R&D Intensity`: R&D / Sales

--

* `Labor Intensity`: Labor Costs / Fixed Assets


---

## "Semiconductors" regression

```{r semiconreg, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/image10.png")
```

---

## "Games" regression

```{r gamesreg, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/img/image11.png")
```

---

##  Tentative conclusions 

--

.pull-left[
* **Semiconductors**
  + Crucial role of `R&D` for innovation, which is linked to `Product Innovation` ðŸ¢‚
  + Negative role of `Process Innovation` ðŸ¢‚
  + `Regulars` (and, possibly, `Non-Regulars`) play an important role ðŸ¢€
  + ðŸ¢€ Positive impact of both **innovation output** (`Patents`) and **innovation input** (`R&D`) on employment
  + `Larger` and `younger` companies are more innovative
]

--

.pull-right[
* **Games**
  + Important role of `R&D` for innovation
  + Crucial role of numerical labor flexibility, measured as `Non-regulars' share`
  + Investment in fixed assets (ðŸ¢‚ `Process Innovation` ) â€” important for services ðŸ¢‚
  + ðŸ¢‚ Adjustment of `regulars`
  + ðŸ¢€ Negative impact of **innovation output** (`Patents`); positive impact of **innovation input** (`R&D`) on employment
]

---

##  Additional findings  

--

+ **Older**  manufacturing firms struggle to innovate

--

+ **Younger**  manufacturing firms employing **non-regulars** innovate more

--

+ **Internationalization** is associated with less innovation for manufacturing companies employing **non-regulars**
