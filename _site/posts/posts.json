L. (2000). Nonstandard employment relations: Part-time, temporary and contract work. Annual review of sociology, 26 (1), 341-365\n\nBackground\n1970s’ oil crises  sluggish economic growth  high unemployment in the West  inability to generate full employment for everyone (Emmenegger, 2009).\nNonstandard employment relations are not new. In fact, internal labor markets in the post-World War II period were more of an exception than a regularity.\nPart-time work\nDefinitions, incidence, trends\nPart-time work – regular wage employment in which the hours of work are less than “normal”. Different definitions across countries:\nU.S.: < 35 hours/week\nJapan: related to a status within the firm – not to hours worked  around 30% of “part-timers” work full time\nPart time proportions:\nU.S.: 20%\nNetherlands: 38%\nScandinavian countries: 20%\nItaly: 5%\n\nRapid increase of part-time employment in Europe:\na way to alleviate unemployment\nmajor source of employment growth since 1980s\n\nIn all industrial countries, most part-time workers are women:\nU.S.: 65%\nGermany, France: 90%\nJapan: 80%\nLower proportion in the U.S. – many students (both male and female) work part-time.\nDemand for part-time jobs\nPre-1970s U.S. – growth of voluntary part-time work  The need of workforce for shorter hours.\nPost-1970s U.S. – growth of involuntary part-time work Employers’ preferences for lower costs and flexible staffing. Expansion of industries such as: services, retail trade, finance, insurance, real estate.\nGood vs. bad part-time jobs\nEurope: part-time work is often associated with low-paid, low-status jobs (sales, catering, cleaning). Legal differences:\nSweden, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain: equal treatment between full- and part-time workers\nU.K., Germany, Japan: part-timers are excluded from comprehensive social coverage\nEmployment intermediaries\nTemporary help agencies\n“Detached workers”: triangular employment relations where a worker establishes connections with several employers.\nChanges in temporary work  business cycles, economic fluctuations. Temporary agencies were largely banned before 1980s. About 60% work in temporary jobs involuntarily. Temporary help agencies – “reserve labor army” that helps employers to address under-staffing and over-staffing.\nMajor temp agencies  firms. Use of temporary workers has become a permanent strategy for them. Yet, hourly costs to employees may be more for temporaries than for permanent employees. In 1995, client firms paid 40% more for temporary workers than they received wages. However, these wages are relatively low.\nDeliberate wage differences – illegal vis-à-vis full-time regular workers, but doable in case of full-time vs. temporary workers. More fringe benefits for regular employees  higher likelihood to use temporary help agencies.\n\n\n\n",
